# Stupid2 - Card game

A multi-platform app I was working on long time ago. Right now, only &rsquo;CLI&rsquo; app is working (play a game on terminal, by running the project).

-   Currently you could try out the rules and play a bit using &rsquo;cli&rsquo; module, by running &rsquo;Main.kt&rsquo;


## Purpose

-   Have fun
-   Try out new tech
    -   Using spek (&rsquo;Kotest&rsquo;) for unit testing (instead of regular JUnit)
    -   Using &rsquo;Compose&rsquo; to build UI
    -   Use networking solution to play online real-time (TCP maybe?)

In short, this is only a playground, feel free to reuse whatever you find it
