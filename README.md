# Stupid2 - Card game


## Story

My first project *ever*, was a card game as well, built on Java Applet (yep, that tech, that time ago). During my vacation from log time ago, I started re-coding the same game out of fun. It got outdated quite fast (was on LibGDX). Scraped platform stuff, moved logic. Now it is forming into something playable (or not ü§∑Ô∏è).


## So what is this?

Wanna be: a multi-platform card game, to play over network. Now: Working card game logic of &rsquo;Stupid&rsquo;

-   Currently you could try out the rules and play a bit using &rsquo;cli&rsquo; module, by running &rsquo;Main.kt&rsquo;


## Purpose

-   Have fun
-   Try out new tech
    -   Using spek (&rsquo;Kotest&rsquo;) for unit testing (instead of regular JUnit)
    -   Using &rsquo;Compose&rsquo; to build UI
    -   Use networking solution to play online real-time (TCP maybe?)

In short, this is only a playground, feel free to reuse whatever you find it
